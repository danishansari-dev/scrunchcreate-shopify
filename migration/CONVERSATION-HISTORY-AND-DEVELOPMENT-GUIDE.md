## 3. Architecture & Implemented Features

### 3.1. Dynamic Hover-Based Mega Menu
- **Snippet:** [`shopify-theme/snippets/scrunch-nav-mega-menu.liquid`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/snippets/scrunch-nav-mega-menu.liquid)
- **Header Section:** [`shopify-theme/sections/header.liquid`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/sections/header.liquid)
- **Mobile Drawer:** [`shopify-theme/snippets/header-drawer.liquid`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/snippets/header-drawer.liquid)
- **How it Works:**
  1. Dynamically queries `collections['all'].products` in Shopify Liquid with zero hardcoding.
  2. Groups products by category (`HairBow`, `Scrunchie`, `GiftHamper`, `FlowerJewellery`, `Hairclip`) and sub-types (e.g. `Classic`, `Combo`, `Satin-Mini`, `Tulip`, `Tulip-Sheer`, `Satin-Printed`).
  3. Lists up to 5 available variant colors per column with direct deep links (`?variant=<id>`), plus a `View all N colors →` link.
  4. Features a 180ms hover debounce controller and an invisible `::before` hit-testing bridge to ensure the dropdown stays open smoothly when moving the cursor from the nav link down into the options.
  5. Active nav category displays the pink underline indicator (`border-bottom: 2px solid #e78592`) and rotating chevron.
  6. Mobile drawer displays expandable accordions for all categories and products.

### 3.2. Product Detail Page (PDP) Variant-to-Image Switching
- **JavaScript Controller:** [`shopify-theme/assets/product-info.js`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/assets/product-info.js)
- **Gallery Snippet:** [`shopify-theme/snippets/product-media-gallery.liquid`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/snippets/product-media-gallery.liquid)
- **Template Config:** [`shopify-theme/templates/product.json`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/templates/product.json) (`gallery_layout`: `"thumbnail_slider"`)
- **How it Works:**
  1. On variant change or initial page load (with `?variant=...`), `product-info.js` extracts the active color name (e.g., `white`, `lavender`, `golden`).
  2. Normalizes color strings (removes hyphens, spaces, converts to lowercase) and matches against all gallery media `src` image filenames.
  3. Smoothly scrolls the thumbnail slider to the matching slide and updates the main media gallery view.

### 3.3. Bespoke Footer & Brand Components
- **Section File:** [`shopify-theme/sections/footer.liquid`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/sections/footer.liquid)
- **Config File:** [`shopify-theme/sections/footer-group.json`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/sections/footer-group.json)
- **How it Works:**
  1. Top newsletter subscription band (`SCRUNCH & CREATE`, "Handmade drops, styling notes, and gift-ready offers." with pill form).
  2. 4-column brand grid: Brand Story, Quick Links (Shop, Best Sellers, Gift Hampers, Wishlist), Help & Policies (Shipping, Returns, Privacy, Terms), and Contact/Instagram.
  3. Live Instagram 4-tile showcase with follow button.
  4. Bottom copyright and `Handcrafted in India` badge.

### 3.4. Product Card Conversion Enhancements
- **Snippet:** [`shopify-theme/snippets/card-product.liquid`](file:///c:/Users/daans/Desktop/scrunchcreate/shopify-theme/snippets/card-product.liquid)
- **How it Works:**
  1. Renders uppercase category badge (e.g. `SCRUNCHIE`, `HAIRBOW`).
  2. Star rating badge (`★★★★★ 4.9`).
  3. Dispatch reassurance note (`In stock, ready to ship • 2-4 days`).

  - `assets/scrunch-custom.css`: Added global `overflow-x: clip` on `html, body` to eliminate horizontal scrollbar/overflow across tablet and desktop viewports.
### Entry 10 — Product Card Color Swatches Redesign & 404 Policy Interception
- **Goal:** Fix product color swatches overlapping with product title headings on the homepage and collection cards; provide rich, accurate hex colors and gradients for all store variants (combos, satins, layered, prints); ensure all policy pages and links render the Policy Hub seamlessly with zero 404 errors.
- **Changes:**
  - `snippets/scrunch-color-swatches.liquid`: Expanded color palette mapping covering all 46 store color and style variants (`black`, `white`, `ruby`, `baby-pink`, `magenta`, `mauve`, `plum`, `emerald`, `mint`, `olive`, `navy`, `petrol`, `sky-blue`, `mustard`, `lavender`, `chocolate`, `beige`, `gold`, `silver`, `pistachio`, `peach`, `combo`, `tulip`, `3-layered`, `jimmi-choo`, `mini-bow`, `pigtail`, `princess`, `scarf`, etc.) with support for multi-color linear gradients and fallback gradients.

### Entry 11 — Footer Instagram Preview Images Fix

### Entry 12 — Instant Product Card Color Swatch Image Switcher

- **Changes:**
  - `snippets/scrunch-color-swatches.liquid`:
    - Updated each swatch button to lookup and associate the matching variant media and alt tags.
    - Embedded `data-image-src`, `data-image-srcset`, `data-image-alt`, and `data-variant-url` attributes for instant client-side lookup.
    - Set accessible `role="radiogroup"` and `role="radio"` with `aria-checked` attributes.
  - `assets/scrunch-custom.css`:

### Entry 13 — Shopify Go-Live Launch Checklist & Operational Roadmap

### Entry 15 — Responsive Header UI & Mobile Drawer Navigation Overhaul
- **Goal:** Overhaul the Shopify theme header across all viewports, specifically targeting tablet and mobile screens to eliminate layout collisions, prevent desktop navigation leakage, modernize the hamburger drawer, and establish flawless 3-column responsive balance.
- **Root Cause Identified:** In `assets/scrunch-custom.css`, `.sc-header-nav` was set to `display: flex !important;` globally without an enclosing media query. This caused desktop mega-menu navigation links to render inline on tablet and mobile viewports, squishing the logo, colliding with the hamburger toggle, and pushing the action icons (Search, Account, Cart) completely off-screen.
- **Changes:**
  - `assets/scrunch-custom.css`:
    - Confined `.sc-header-nav` strictly to `@media screen and (min-width: 990px)` with mobile-first `display: none !important;`.
    - Implemented a balanced 3-column CSS Grid (`minmax(44px, 1fr) auto minmax(44px, 1fr)`) on viewports `< 990px` to maintain true centering of the brand logo.
    - Added responsive typography scaling (`clamp(16.5px, 4vw, 21px)`) for the header logo to guarantee zero text wrapping or horizontal scrolling down to 320px.
    - Standardized action icon touch targets (40px on tablet/mobile, 36px on small mobile) and aligned the red cart count badge (`#e11d48`) with `top: 4px; right: 4px;`.
    - Modernized the mobile navigation drawer with elevated white background (`#ffffff`), smooth cubic-bezier transitions, 16px semibold item links, warm pink hover tints, and clean divider lines.
    - Converted vertically stacked drawer social icons into a clean horizontal flex row with rounded circular badges and interactive hover effects.
  - `snippets/scrunch-nav-mega-menu.liquid`: Updated base CSS to mobile-first `display: none;` and enforced desktop-only presentation at `min-width: 990px`.
  - `snippets/header-drawer.liquid`: Styled category spotlight links (`.sc-drawer-all-link`) with brand pink accent pill styling and updated back navigation button styles.
  - `sections/header.liquid`: Linked `component-list-social.css` in the header for proper social icon styling.
- **Status:** Complete & Verified across Desktop (1440x900), Tablet (768x1024, 600x800), Mobile Large (414x896), Mobile Small (360x740), Mobile Tiny (320x568), and Collection page (`/collections/all`).

- **Changes:**
  - `snippets/scrunch-whatsapp.liquid`: Added `MutationObserver` targeting `<cart-drawer>` to dynamically add `.sc-wa-widget--hidden` when the drawer is open, preventing the high z-index floating WhatsApp FAB from overlapping the primary "Check out" CTA on mobile.

  - `sections/main-cart-items.liquid`: Added dynamic Free Shipping progress meter (₹499 threshold) above item table on the standalone `/cart` page.
  - `sections/main-cart-footer.liquid`: Added matching trust badges under the `/cart` page checkout CTA button.
- **Verification & Deployment:**
  - Theme Check: 173 files inspected with 0 errors.
  - Deployed live to Shopify theme `#186623852655` via CLI (`100% upload success`).
  - End-to-end browser testing verified on Desktop (1440×900) and Mobile (390×844) with full screenshots.
- **Status:** Complete & Verified.
